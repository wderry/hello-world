# hello-world
This is my first GitHub Project. Is it the recommended first project because of the programming ritual of naming your first program in a language you are just learning "hello world".

While I have used GitHub I have never gone through the tutorial. I want to see if I can add to my overall understanding by going through a structured introduction.
